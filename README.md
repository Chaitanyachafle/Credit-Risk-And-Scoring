Credit Data Exploratory Analysis and Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation

**Problem Statement**
This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deep analysis of a dataset containing customer details and extensive credit-related information. The primary goal is to create new, informative features, develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score, and uncover patterns and insights within the data that could help in assessing creditworthiness and potential risks.

Dataset

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the structure, characteristics, and relationships within the data.
Visualize patterns and insights using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices.
Handle missing values, data type mismatches, and outliers.
Feature Engineering

Creation of new, informative features based on domain knowledge and EDA insights.
Aggregation of data on the customer level if necessary to enhance analysis.
Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation

Develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score using 5â€“10 features inspired by FICO scores.
Experiment with different weighting schemes and provide a detailed explanation of the selected approach.
Assign a credit score for each customer, providing justifications for feature selection and criteria.
Analysis and Insights

Uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data.
Investigate if the credit score and features can be calculated for different time frames, such as the last 3 or 6 months.
Provide actionable insights and strategies for improving credit risk assessment.
